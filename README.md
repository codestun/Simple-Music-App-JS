# Simple-Music-App-JS
Playground App for learning JS

The goal is to build a small web application with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that loads
data from an external API and enables the viewing of data points in detail.

In order to focus mainly on JS and less on HTML and CSS, I decided to include Tailwind in my project.
